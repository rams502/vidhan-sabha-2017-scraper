# vidhan-sabha-2017-scraper

###### Samuel Frantz, Department of Political Science, George Washington University

These Python scripts use BeautifulSoup 4 to scrape the 2017 Vidhan Sabha (state assembly) results from five states (Goa, Punjab, Manipur, Uttarakhand, and Uttar Pradesh) and save them in .csv format. There is one script for each state. They collect data from http://www.eciresults.nic.in. 

For demonstration purposes, I have also included a version that scrapes the [2016 Assam election results](https://web.archive.org/web/20160522160308/http://eciresults.nic.in/ConstituencywiseS0334.htm?ac=34) from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine. This script should continue to work even if the 2017 results are removed on the Election Commission of India (ECI) website.

Finally, the repository includes the results collected from the ECI website on March 11, 2017.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.
